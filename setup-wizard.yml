    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Teku up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Teku from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Teku docs](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/Checkpoint-Start/)
      Use the dappnode official endpoint **https://checkpoint-sync.dappnode.io** or get your checkpoint sync from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-chain.infura.io)
      Note If you are going to use your check sync point url, to use it make sure you dont use a slash (/) at the end of the url.

      Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node. After The Merge, execution clients will begin depositing priority fees into this address whenever your validator client proposes a new block.
